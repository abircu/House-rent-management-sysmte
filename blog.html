                <h4>House Rent Management System</h4>
                <p>We are stuck with technology when what we really
                    want is just stuff that works. With the current paradigm shift in
                    the technological field, there is an urgent need to embrace and
                    appreciate the power of technology. The housing sector remains
                    vigilant to face the challenges of change by employing a new
                    strategy that facilitates easy management of rental houses. Hence
                    there is a need to develop a rental house management system that
                    can simplify work for the rental managers so that all their work
                    can be efficient and effective.
                     To get information about how rental houses are currently
                    being managed, I prepared questionnaires and submitted them to
                    a number of rental house managers and from the information, I
                    gathered I realized all work was done manually with a lot of
                    paperwork involved. Papers can easily get damaged or get lost
                    leading to loss of data. It is also expensive to keep on buying
                    files to store your records. A lot of files make a place look untidy
                    and also consume a lot of space. Getting a certain file to check
                    data from many files becomes a difficult task.
                     Considering those facts, I decided to develop a rental house
                    management system that can solve all the problems experienced
                    with the current manual system. The system was developed in
                    such a manner that it provides a maximum user-friendly interface.
                     Once you the user logs in the system automatically show
                    three forms: houses form, rent payment form, and tenants‟
                    registration form. Each form has several command buttons; new,
                    save, cancel, delete, next, previous, and exit. With the command
                    buttons, you can manipulate the database. If you want to add data
                    to the database all you need to do is to click on new then input
                    data in the text boxes provided then click save and the data will
                    automatically be saved. If you want to view data in the database
                    you just click next or previous and the data will be displayed for
                    you. When you click delete you will be able to delete a record
                    that you desire. You may enter data and then decide to cancel it, it is
                    a simple click on cancel and it will be canceled.
                     For managers faced with management difficulties here is a
                    perfect solution for you. The rental house management system is
                    made for you.</p>
